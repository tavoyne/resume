        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I live in Paris. I'm currently building ResumeStudio, a
          next-generation web resume builder. Before that, I was running a web
          development studio called BlackJelly. I have a Computer Science degree
          from UCL. I'm a hard worker, I'm obsessed with performance, I practice
          piano two hours a day, I'm married and I never believed in Bitcoin.

            <h3>ResumeStudio</h3>

            <p>
              ResumeStudio is a SaaS for building remarkable and
              standards-compliant resumes in minutes. I'm making it from the
              ground up. I have no partner or employee yet, so I'm doing
              everything, from design to development. I spend my days trying to
              make it better, more performant, and more accessible than its
              competitors—it's not doing bad, check
              <a href="https://benchmark.resume.studio"
                >benchmark.resume.studio</a
              >. How? By relying on native features instead of self-maintained
              code and external libraries. I hope it'll shortly start eating up
              Canva's $50M's worth of market shares.

              BlackJelly was a web development studio that specialized in the
              making of experimental websites. We won a dozen of awards for our
              work. Running it for one and a half years taught me how to hire
              developers and designers, how to collaborate with them and, above
              all, it made me fall in love with the Lighthouse score of 100. I
              shut down the company to focus on ResumeStudio.

              StudentCV was an e-commerce website selling resume templates. I
              built it while I was still a student. The acquisition strategy was
              100% organic, with users from France and Africa. It reached $110K
              in revenue in 2017. Working on this project, I learned about the
              specificities of the employment market and the difficulties people
              experience when using text-editing software.
